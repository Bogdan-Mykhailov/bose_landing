<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>The landing page is structured using the BEM methodology, which stands for Block, Element, Modifier. This methodology is a way of organizing CSS code that makes it easier to read, understand, and maintain.</p>

<p>The landing page consists of several different blocks, including the header, navigation section, recommended section, categories section, how to buy section, contacts and footer. Each block is made up of one or more elements, which are styled using BEM classes. For example, the recommended section contains a title element, which is styled with the class 

```  
recommended__title
  ```
</p>
<p>In addition to the BEM methodology and SCSS, the landing page also utilizes the AOS (Animate On Scroll) JavaScript library to add some animation effects. AOS is a lightweight library that allows you to animate elements as they come into view, adding some interactivity to the page without being too distracting.</p>

<p>The landing page also includes some custom JavaScript code to add some additional functionality.</p>
<p>To ensure consistent code formatting, the landing page also utilizes Stylelint, a CSS linter that checks your code for syntax errors and style violations.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall, this landing page for Bose is a clean and modern design that showcases the brand's products in an attractive and engaging way. Using the BEM methodology and SCSS made it easier to organize and maintain the code, while the AOS library and custom JavaScript code added some interactivity and animation effects to the page. Gulp and Stylelint were also used to streamline the development process and ensure consistent code formatting.</p>
